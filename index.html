    <h2>Religious views</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Timur was a practising Sunni 
        <a href="#">Muslim</a>
        , possibly belonging to the 
        <a href="#">Naqishbandi</a>
         school, which was influential in Transoxiana.
         <a href="#"><sup>[127]</sup></a>
          His chief official religious counsellor and adviser was the 
          <a href="#">Hanafi</a>
           scholar 'Abdu'l-Jabbar Khwarazmi. In
            <a href="#">Tirmidh</a>
            , he had come under the influence of his spiritual mentor 
            <a href="#">Sayyid Baraka</a>
            , a leader from 
            <a href="#">Balkh </a>
            who is buried alongside Timur in 
            <a href="#">Gur-e-Amir</a>. <a href="#"><sup>[128][129][130]</sup></a></p>
    <p>Timur was known to hold 
        <a href="#">Ali </a>
        and the 
        <a href="#">Ahl al-Bayt </a>
        in high regard and has been noted by various scholars for his "pro- 
        <a href="#">Shia</a>
        " stance. However, he also punished Shias for desecrating the memories of the 
        <a href="#">Sahaba</a>. <a href="#"><sup>[131]</sup></a>
         Timur was also noted for attacking the Shia with Sunni apologism, while at other times he attacked Sunnis on religious grounds as well. <a href="#"><sup>[132]</sup></a>
          In contrast, Timur held the
           <a href="#">Seljuk </a>
           Sultan 
           <a href="#">Ahmad Sanjar </a>
           in high regard for attacking the
            <a href="#">Ismailis </a>and <a href="#">Alamut</a>
            , and Timur's own attack on Ismailis at
             <a href="#">Anjudan </a>
             was equally brutal.

    <h2>Personality</h2>

    <img src="./Снимок экрана (22).png" alt="Timur" width="200" align="right">
    <p>Timur is regarded as military genuis and as a brilliant tactician with an uncanny ability to work within a hihghly fluid political structure to win and maintain a loyal following of nomads during his rule in Central Asia. He was also considered extraordinarily intelligent-not only intuitively but also intellectually.
        <a href="#"><sup>[133]</sup></a>
        In Samarkand and his many travels, Timur, under the guidance of distinguished
         scholars, was able to learn the 
        <a href="#">Persian</a>,<a href="#">Mongolian</a>, and <a href="#">Turkish </a>languages <a href="#"><sup>[134]</sup></a>
         (according to <a href="#">Ahmad ibn Arabshah</a>, Timur could not speak <a href="#">Arabic</a>). <a href="#"><sup>[135]</sup></a>
         However, it was Persian which was held in distinction by Timur as it was the language not only of his court, but also that of his chancellery.
          <a href="#"><sup>[136]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>According to 
        <a href="#">John Josep Saunders</a>, 
        Timur was "the product of an Islamized an Irlanized society", and not steppe nomadic.
        <a href="#"><sup>[137] </sup></a>
        More importantly, Timur was characterized as an opportunist. Taking advantage of his Turco-Mongolian heritage, Timur frequently used either the Islamic religion or the 
        <a href="#">sharia law</a>, <a href="#">fiqh</a>, 
        learned king, and enjoyed the company of scholars; he was tolerant and generous to them. He was a contemporary of the Persian poet 
        <a href="#">Hafez</a>, 
        and a story of their meeting explains that Timur summoned Hafiz, who had written a 
        <a href="#">ghazal</a> 
        with the following verse:
    
    </p>
         <p>For the black mole on thy cheek</p>
         <p>I would give the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara.</p>
